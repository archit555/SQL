--Imagine that I am a part of the OLA Finance Team. I want to unnderstand in India what is the revenue and
--number of taxis of each cab type in India this month. Write a SQL Code to get the expected output from
--table1 and table2. Be cautious if you are using simple join ('avoid using "union" as it is inefficient approach')

#Creating Sample Tables
create table Table1 ("Cab Type" varchar(30), Revenue int, City varchar(30));

create table Table2 ("Cab Type" varhcar(30), "Number of taxis" int, District varchar(30));

#Inserting values in the Tables

INSERT INTO Table1 values ('Ola Prime', 2 , 'Bengaluru');
INSERT INTO Table1 values ('Ola Prime', 3 , 'Chennai');
INSERT INTO Table1 values ('Ola SUV', 1.2 , 'Delhi');
INSERT INTO Table1 values ('Ola SUV', 4.4 , 'Mumbai');
INSERT INTO Table1 values ('Ola SUV', 1.5 , 'Kolkatta');

select * from Table2

INSERT INTO Table2 values ('Ola Prime', 112 , 'Bengaluru');
INSERT INTO Table2 values ('Ola Prime', 443 , 'Chennai');
INSERT INTO Table2 values ('Ola SUV', 102 , 'Delhi');
INSERT INTO Table2 values ('Ola SUV', 464 , 'Mumbai');
INSERT INTO Table2 values ('Ola SUV', 124 , 'Surat');
